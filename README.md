fish.rb
=======

A (fish)[http://esolangs.org/wiki/Fish] interpreter in ruby.

There is a slew of examples in the examples directory.

Todo
----

There are some unfinished things that I will get done in the
next couple of days.

 * Command line options - same sort of thing fish.py has
 * Gemification - everyone loves rubygems :P

 
Thoughts
--------

Something that would be fun to implment is jit. While a straight
compiler would be very dificult due to reflection I don't think
jit would be to hard if implemented the way rubinius does thiers.
It would take a lot of time though, so it is doubtful it will happen.

If you have trouble with fish.rb for whatever reason just open an issue.
I love it when poeple use my software so give it a go.
