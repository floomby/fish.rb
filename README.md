I am fairly convinced that it meets the spec with one exception.
It fails to write floating points to the code box, this needs to
be fixed.

 
Thoughts
--------

Something that would be fun to implment is jit. While a straight
compiler would be very dificult due to reflection I don't think
jit would be to hard if implemented the way rubinius does thiers.
It would take a lot of time though, so it is doubtful it will happen.

If you have trouble with fish.rb for whatever reason just open an issue.
I love it when poeple use my software so give it a go.
